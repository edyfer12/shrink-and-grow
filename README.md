# shrink-and-grow

This page will show how the outer (flex container) and inner boxes (flex items) shrink and grow as screen sizes are adjusted differently on the browser.
In order to easily identify the difference between the flex items, background colours are used in CSS. To indicate that there is a flex container, colour
of the border will be in purple.
